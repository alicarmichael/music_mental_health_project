# 🎵 Music Preferences and Mental Health  
**DSCI 311: Principles & Techniques of Data Science**

## Overview
This project was completed as part of **DSCI 311: Principles & Techniques of Data Science**. It is a **self-guided data science project** in which I independently identified a dataset, formulated research questions, and applied core data science methods including **exploration, inference, and prediction**.

The project investigates relationships between **music preferences** and **self-reported mental health indicators** using survey data.

---

## Research Questions
This project explores questions such as:

- Does the genre of music people listen to most frequently change their anxiety scoring?
- Can music genre and listening habits predict a persons anxiety score?

---

## Data
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Original Survey Creator:** Catherine Rasgaitis, Undergraduate student, University of Washington  
- **Type:** Self-reported survey data  
- **Content Includes:**
  - Music genre preferences
  - Listening habits
  - Self-reported mental health ratings (e.g., anxiety, depression, insomnia)

**Notes:**
- Data are observational and self-reported
- Mental health variables are subjective and not clinical diagnoses
- Results are interpreted with caution due to sampling and reporting bias

## Methods

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of demographic factors and listening habits
- Genre popularity and listening trends
- Visualization of mental health scoring

### 2. Inference
- Summary statistics and hypothesis-driven comparisons
- Discussion of uncertainty and limitations

### 3. Prediction
- Supervised learning models to predict mental health outcomes
- Interpretation of model coefficients and limitations

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## Files & Organization
- Notebooks include exploratory analysis, modeling, and interpretation
- Code and figures are documented to support reproducibility
